		<p> A <em>jigsaw puzzle</em> (with context, sometimes just <em>jigsaw</em> or just <em>puzzle</em>) is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often irregularly shaped interlocking and mosaicked pieces, each of which typically has a portion of a picture. When assembled, the puzzle pieces produce a complete picture.</p>
		
		<p><span class="name">John Spilsbury</span>, a London cartographer, is believed to have produced the first jigsaw puzzle around 1760, using a marquetry saw.</p>
		
		<p>Most modern jigsaw puzzles are made of paperboard as they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce. An enlarged photograph or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional artwork is glued to cardboard, which is then fed into a press. The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired pattern, called a puzzle die, through the board until fully cut.<img class="inlineimage" src="img/naturepuzzle.jpg" alt="NaturePuzzle"></p>
		
		
		<p> Typical images on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from nature, buildings, and repetitive designsâ€”castles and mountains are common, as well as other traditional subjects. However, any picture can be used. Artisan puzzle-makers and companies using technologies for one-off and small print-run puzzles utilize a wide range of subject matter, including optical illusions, unusual art, and personal photographs. In addition to traditional flat, two-dimensional puzzles, three-dimensional puzzles have entered large-scale production, including spherical puzzles and architectural recreations.</p>
